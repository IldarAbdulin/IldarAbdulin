# Ildar Abdulin: Passionate Frontend Developer

Hello, I'm Ildar Abdulin, a Frontend Developer with 1 years of solid experience specializing in revitalizing legacy projects and crafting user-friendly interfaces.

## My Professional Journey üöÄ

I studied Frontend Developer for 2 year, during that time I wrote a lot of my pet projects

## Work experience

- BOOSTER TECHNOLOGIES ( 1 year experience )

I started by fixing bugs and gradually transitioned to page layout, adding logic, and working with data‚Äîretrieving, sending, and modifying it. I always met deadlines and proactively took on additional tasks from colleagues to ensure the team met all deadlines.

I worked remotely with a team on an application for a sewing shop using React and GraphQL. I had no prior experience with GraphQL, but I quickly learned it in the process. We had daily standups, and every two weeks, we gathered at the studio for sprint planning.

In the project, I initially worked in the Sewing team, where I implemented many key features. These included:

Phone number, login, and password-based authorization.

A model creation page with extensive business logic: it was possible to create and edit materials, select types of materials, specify timing, add and remove colors, choose units of measurement, write comments, mark them as important, and upload photos.

Implementation of a Kanban board for order details with real-time order progress (e.g., if someone was purchasing materials, it immediately appeared on the board).

Later, I was transferred to a new project called Stock, where I was the sole frontend developer. Some of the most interesting tasks included:

Implementing OAuth authorization.

A warehouse page displaying orders, their details (sizes, amounts), and two viewing modes: tabular and card view with images and brief information.

Integrating a Kanban board to track order statuses in the warehouse.

## My Focus Areas üîç

- **Code Optimization**: I am always on the lookout for opportunities to improve existing code, whether it's refactoring for better readability or enhancing performance.

- **Application Architecture**: I have experience in manipulating the app's architecture and main components to optimize processes within the app, improving performance and user experience.

## Continuous Learning üìö

I am dedicated to continuous learning and stay up-to-date with the latest libraries, frameworks, and methods to enhance the user experience and bring cutting-edge solutions to my projects.
